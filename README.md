# abTEM examples

This repository contains some examples of TEM simulations using abTEM. See the [main repository](https://github.com/jacobjma/abTEM) for more information.

You can try abTEM online using binder. Note, due to constraints of computational resources, we recommend only trying the notebooks in the Binder.
