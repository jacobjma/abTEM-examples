[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jacobjma/abTEM-examples/master)

This repository contains some examples of TEM simulations using abTEM. See the [main repository](https://github.com/jacobjma/abTEM) for more information.

You can try abTEM online using binder. Note, due to constraints of computational resources, we recommend only trying the notebooks in the Binder.
